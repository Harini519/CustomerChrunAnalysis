The Decision Tree Regressor achieved a high accuracy score of 0.999 on both training and testing data, indicating that it was able to fit and generalize the data well.

 Random Forest Regressor
In addition to the decision tree, a Random Forest Regressor was also applied. This model uses multiple decision trees to improve performance and reduce overfitting.

The results were similarly impressive, with an accuracy score close to 0.999 on both training and testing data.

Linear Regression
Finally, a Linear Regression model was tested. While linear regression is simpler compared to tree-based models, it provides insight into the linear relationships between the features and the target variable.

The Linear Regression model showed a similar performance, with an accuracy close to 0.999.

Key Findings
Model Performance: All models (Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and Linear Regression) performed exceptionally well, with accuracy scores near 0.999. This indicates that the dataset is well-structured and that the models were able to predict churn effectively.
Important Features: Features such as tenure, Contract, and MonthlyCharges were most significant in predicting churn. Customers with longer tenures and those on longer contracts tend to have lower churn rates.
Churn Prediction: Customers on month-to-month contracts or those with higher monthly charges were more likely to churn.

Recommendations
Based on the findings from the exploratory analysis and predictive modeling, here are some recommendations for the telecom company:

Offer Long-Term Contracts: Customers on month-to-month contracts have a higher churn rate. Incentivizing customers to switch to longer-term contracts (e.g., one or two-year contracts) may help reduce churn.
Adjust Pricing Strategy: High monthly charges correlate with higher churn rates. Offering discounts or revising pricing models for high-paying customers could reduce churn.
Target High-Risk Customers: Use the churn prediction model to identify customers at risk of leaving and offer retention offers, such as discounted services or additional support.
 Conclusion
This analysis has successfully demonstrated that machine learning models can effectively predict customer churn in a telecommunications context. The Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and Linear Regression models all showed excellent performance, achieving near-perfect accuracy. Key features such as tenure, Contract type, and MonthlyCharges were found to be critical in predicting churn.

By leveraging these models, the company can identify high-risk customers early and take proactive steps to improve customer retention.
